# S3 Speedometer

This project is a simple server + react app that calls as many S3 getObject requests as it can and shows real time graph of the speed.

It was used to show a demo of noobaa multicloud with locality optimization.

It is unmaintained but kept for reference.


In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm install` - Install dependencies to node_modules
- `node server` - Runs the backend that calls S3 requests and reports it to react app.
- `npm start` - Runs the react app in development mode at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

(this project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))
